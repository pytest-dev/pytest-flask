Changelog
=========

1.0.0 (UNRELEASED)
------------------

- Python 2.7 is no longer supported.

0.15.1 (2020-02-03)
-------------------

- Fix ``ImportError`` with ``Werkzeug 1.0.0rc1`` (`#105`_).

.. _#105: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-flask/pull/105

0.15.0 (2019-05-13)
-------------------

- Properly register the ``options`` marker (`#97`_).

.. _#97: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-flask/pull/97

0.14.0 (2018-10-15)
-------------------

- New ``--live-server-host`` command-line option to set the host name used by
  the ``live_server`` fixture.

  Thanks `@o1da`_ for the PR (`#90`_).

.. _#90: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-flask/pull/90

0.13.0 (2018-09-29)
-------------------

- ``JSONReponse`` now supports comparison directly with status codes:

  .. code-block:: python

      assert client.get('invalid-route', headers=[('Accept', 'application/json')]) == 404

  Thanks `@dusktreader`_ for the PR (`#86`_).

.. _#86: https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-flask/pull/86

0.12.0 (2018-09-06)
-------------------

- ``pytest-flask`` now requires ``pytest>=3.6`` (`#84`_).

- Add new ``--live-server-port`` option to select the port the live server will use (`#82`_).
  Thanks `@RazerM`_ for the PR.

- Now ``live_server`` will try to stop the server cleanly by emitting a ``SIGINT`` signal and
  waiting 5 seconds for the server to shutdown. If the server is still running after 5 seconds,
  it will be forcefully terminated. This behavior can be changed by passing
  ``--no-live-server-clean-stop`` in the command-line (`#49`_).
  Thanks `@jadkik`_ for the PR.

- Internal fixes silence pytest warnings, more visible now with ``pytest-3.8.0`` (`#84`_).
