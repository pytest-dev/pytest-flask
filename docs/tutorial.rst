Getting started
===============

Pytest is capable to pick up and run existing tests without any or little
configuration. This section describes how to get started quickly.

Step 1. Install
---------------

``pytest-flask`` is available on `PyPi`_, and can be easily installed via
``pip``::

    pip install pytest-flask


Step 2. Configure
-----------------

Define your application fixture in ``conftest.py``:

.. code:: python

    from myapp import create_app

    @pytest.fixture
    def app():
        app = create_app()
        return app


Step 3. Run your test suite
---------------------------

Use the ``pytest`` command to run your test suite::

    pytest

.. note:: Test discovery.

    Pytest `discovers your tests`_ and has a built-in integration with other
    testing tools (such as ``nose``, ``unittest`` and ``doctest``). More
    comprehensive examples and use cases can be found in the `official
    documentation`_.


Whatâ€™s next?
------------

The :ref:`features` section gives a more detailed view of available features, as
well as test fixtures and markers.

Consult the `pytest documentation <https://pytest.org/en/latest>`_ for more
information about pytest itself.

If you want to contribute to the project, see the :ref:`contributing` section.
